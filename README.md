## About this game
*Even bees are part of the gig economy. Navigate flowerbeds, collect pollen and sell it at different hives to buy upgrades and become a very wealthy bee. Hide under leaves to avoid getting eaten by birds and try not to get bullied by useless carpenter bees. The more pollen you carry, the worse you'll fly - so bee smart.*

* Trade in your pollen for cold hard cash to buy useful upgrades.
* Don't carry too much pollen - it'll be hard to fly!

### Known Issues

1. Weird level geometry - sometimes stuff spawns outside the bounds of the world. Not gamebreaking, just ugly.
2. Game over is still a little janky.
3. No real end game - progression is kind of pointless.
4. Lots of inefficient and badly organized code -- this game was an exercise in actually _finishing_ a project, which meant prioritizing finished work over nice shiny code. 

As of November 28th, I'm out of time to work on this game jam, so this project is complete for the time being.
This project is complete, so these issues will likely persist.
